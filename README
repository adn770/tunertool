Tuner is a simple tool to help tuning instruments.

It's based on gstreamer and uses kissfft to perform a FFT on the signal
captured on the microphone, extract the fundamental frequency and
correlate it with a table that associate frequencies and musical
tones.

It was primarilly written as a self introductory project on gstreamer.

Enjoy with this in your tablet :)
